- ❌ **Cons**: 
  - Loses all positional information
  - May miss important sequence patterns
  - Oversimplified for complex binding interactions

### 2.3 Efficient One-Hot Encoding (CHOSEN APPROACH)
**Approach**: Position-aware feature extraction with interpretable aggregations
- ✅ **Pros**: 
  - Optimal feature count (115 features)
  - Retains positional information

## 3. Efficient One-Hot Encoding: Technical Details

### 3.1 Feature Categories (115 Total Features)

#### A. Amino Acid Counts (20 features)
- **Purpose**: Global composition analysis
- **Features**: `count_A`, `count_R`, ..., `count_V`
- **Interpretation**: Total occurrences of each amino acid

#### B. Regional Composition Analysis (60 features)
- **N-terminal region** (20 features): First 10% of sequence
- **C-terminal region** (20 features): Last 10% of sequence  
- **Central region** (20 features): Middle 80% of sequence
- **Purpose**: Capture position-dependent patterns critical for protein function

#### C. Physicochemical Properties by Region (15 features)
- **Properties**: Hydrophobic, polar, positively charged, negatively charged, special
- **Regions**: N-terminal, C-terminal, central
- **Purpose**: Encode biologically relevant chemical properties

#### D. Positional Gradients (20 features)
- **Calculation**: C-terminal frequency - N-terminal frequency per amino acid
- **Purpose**: Detect directional trends in sequence composition
- **Interpretation**: Positive values indicate C-terminal enrichment

### 3.2 Biological Rationale

1. **Protein Domains**: Many proteins have functionally distinct regions (N-term, C-term, central)
2. **Binding Sites**: Often located in specific sequence regions
3. **Kinase Structure**: Active sites frequently in central domains with specific terminal characteristics
4. **Drug Interactions**: Binding pockets influenced by local amino acid composition
